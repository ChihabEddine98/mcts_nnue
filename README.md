# mcts_nnue
Monte-Carlo Tree Search applied on NNUE (Stockfish Neural Net) 

# TODO
- [x] Test Chess-python library for representation
- [x] Call NNUE library
- [ ] Test NNUE evaluation
- [ ] Implement UBFM-Safe-Minimax : https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~cazenave/papers/MinimaxStrikesBack.pdf
- [ ] Optimize DRL model 
- [ ] Implement MCTS search
- [ ] Optimize DRL model 
- [ ] Compare performances on Stoskfish v13
- [ ] Try to implement this previous searches approachs in C++ (more optimization)
